	Workbench layout system customization
	This simple code tells the AIBench Workbench how to create its layout. It's like a table, where cells are separated by splitters. 
	You can edit this file to move or put put more slots with the <components> tag. Then you can put your custom components 
	(defined in your plugin.xml) in these slots.
	hidetabs: if there is only one component in the slot, do not use a tabbed panel
-->
<table>
	<row>
		<cell width="25%" oneTouchExpandable="true">
			<table>
				<row>
					<cell>
						<components id='left' />
