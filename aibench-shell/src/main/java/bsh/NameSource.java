 * NameSource is the lightest weight mechanism for sources which wish to support
 * name completion. In the future it might be better for NameSpace to implement
 * NameCompletion directly in a more native and efficient fasion. However in
 * general name competion is used for human interaction and therefore does not
 * require high performance.
